If a file is identified as a virus, it is either logged or not uploaded to the server. The application relies on the underlying ClamAV virus scanning engine, which the admin points Nextcloud to when configuring the application.\nFor this app to be effective, the ClamAV virus definitions should be kept up to date. Also note that enabling this app will impact system performance as additional processing is required for every upload. More information is available in the Antivirus documentation." : "文件反病毒是Nextcloud上一款基于ClamAV的反病毒应用。\n\n* 🕵️‍♂️ 当用户上传文件时，文件会被检测\n* ☢️ 上传且被感染的文件将被删除，同时会显示一个通知和/或发送一封邮件\n* 🔎 后台任务扫描所有文件\n\n此应用会在文件上传到Nextcloud但还没写入Nextcloud存储时对文件做病毒检查。如果一个文件被识别为病毒，它将记录到日志中或禁止被上传到服务器。此应用依赖下层的ClamAV病毒扫描引擎，管理员在配置应用时需要将Nextcloud指向它。\n此应用要起作用，ClamAV的病毒定义应保持更新到最新。同样需要注意的是启用此应用会影响系统性能，因为每次上传都要进行额外的处理。更多信息请参考反病毒应用的文档。",
